# Markov-Chains-in-Diffusion-Models

This project analyses the use of Markov Chains in Diffusion Models. It delves into the theoretical underpinnings of diffusion models, de-
tailing the stochastic processes and variational objectives that govern their behavior.
Furthermore, we explore practical applications such as inpainting, where missing or
corrupted regions in images are reconstructed seamlessly, and extend the discussion
to D3PM (Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which generalize the
framework to discrete data domains.
